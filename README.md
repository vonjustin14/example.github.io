# MAGSALITA (SPEAK UP!)

## The purpose
#### I have a girlfriend who happens to be a Speech therapist. One day, she said to me "If only there is an app or website that my clients can just click and it would talk for them in Filipino". And that's where I got the inspiration of doing this website, MAGSALITA (SPEAK UP!).

#### This website helps people with speech impediment to speak out and respond in Filipino language to common questions or express what they like. The user will simply click to the button and the computer will speak out for them! If they are curious in the Filipino language, this website can also be their starting point.

## The initialization
#### I have come up to do this via HTML CSS and Javascript. First, I have constructed the Home page 'home.html' where I also started to design the website via styles.css. Next, I created the other webpages such as greeting.html, requesting.html and affirming&rejecting.html. I would need to create a logo and find clip arts that I would incorporate to each buttons, hence I resorted to create them in Canva.

#### Then, I would need a function that would prompt the HTTP to play a recording when a certain button is clicked. I have learned the audio code here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18826147/javascript-audio-play-on-click. Then, I resorted to bootstrap to choose which colors to put on each buttons. How did I do the 3 columns in a webpage? I checked the code in w3schools.com for this one.

#### I actually had a hard time thinking if I will use python or flask for this. I would really want to use them but I concluded that HTML CSS and Javascript are enough to serve the purpose of this website.

## The specifics
#### For the Home page, I created the nav bar with all the other webpages included. I also ensured that the website logo is uploaded in a large scale so it would be easily read. Then, I wrote the website purpose on the bottom part. I also put a sample button to entice the user on on how to use the website. Then, I also placed a note that people who are curious on the Filipino language can also make this website as a starting point.

#### For the greeting page, I created the nav bar with all the other webpages included. I also ensured that the images and texts are well aligned and also I added an English translation in a smaller font size for each buttons. I have decided to make the question button blue, the positive responses in green, and the negative response in red.

#### For the requesting page, I created the nav bar with all the other webpages included. I also ensured that all the images are aligned together with all the texts inside the button. I also made sure that the columns are three in this case so that I can separate the appropriate starting phrase with the objects. For example, if the user clicked 'Gusto ko ng', they should click whatever it is below it, say 'pagkain'. In the event that the user clicked 'Gusto kong' button, they can go directly below or may add another phrase 'pumunta sa' button to choose places they like.

#### For the affirming$rejecting page, I have designed it so that the opposites will be aligned with each other horizontally. I assigned green button for the positives and red for the negatives. These are stand alone one-word sentences.

## The conclusion
#### Overall, I conclude that I have created something out of all the lessons I learned in CS50 and I would like to extend my gratitute to your team. This is the best computer science course I have encountered and I will bring the lessons as I change my career from a Chemical Engineer to a Software Engineer.

## The recommendations
#### I would recommend exploring python and flask for improving this website. The buttons can be added to an empty linked list and the user may want to play all the added buttons altogether for hear the full sentence completely. Perhaps they can explore arguments and functions that are available in python and may use this with flask.
